# Baseball-Clustering
A script using either advanced stats or traditional stats to attempt to cluster baseball players into different types. This allows you to attempt to cluster using kmeans clustering, or visualize the n-dimensional data in a two dimensional format. The train function asks for four inputs: 

year: (int) meaning year to date of when you want to take stats from
advanced: (boolean) whether or not you want to use advanced stats (this excludes traditional stats)
visualize: (boolean) whether or not you want to visualize the n-dimensional data as two dimensions instead of clustering
epsilon: (float) how close together you feel the clusters can acceptably be
